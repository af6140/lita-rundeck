[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/harlanbarnes/lita-rundeck.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/harlanbarnes/lita-rundeck)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/harlanbarnes/lita-rundeck/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/harlanbarnes/lita-rundeck)

**lita-rundeck** is a handler for [Lita](https://github.com/jimmycuadra/lita) that interacts with a [Rundeck](http://rundeck.org/) server.

## Installation

Add lita-rundeck to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "lita-rundeck"
```

## Configuration

### Required Attributes

* ```url``` (String) - URL to then Rundeck server. Default: ```nil```
* ```token``` (String) - API token for access to the Rundeck server. Default: ```nil```

### Optional Attributes

* ```api_debug``` (Boolean) - When ```conf.robot.log_level``` is set to ```:debug``` enable verbose details of the API interaction. Default: ```false```

### Example

```ruby
Lita.configure do |config|
  config.handlers.rundeck.url = "https://rundeck.mycompany.org"
  config.handlers.rundeck.token = "abcdefghijzlmnopqrstuvwxyz"
  config.handlers.rundeck.use_runas = false
  config.handlers.rundeck.api_debug = true
end
```

## Usage

### Run

Start a job execution. Optionally, have Lita return part or all of the output log to the channel when complete.

Syntax:
```
rundeck run ALIAS|--project NAME --job NAME [--options KEY=VALUE,KEY=VALUE] [--report all|NUMBER]
```

* Pass either an alias name or `--project` AND `--name` to execute the job
* Optionally, pass Job options (defined in rundeck itself) as key/value pairs delimited by a comma
* Finally, add `--report` with the string `all` to return the entirety of the log output to the channel once the job is complete. (Note Lita won't begin checking for job completion until the average duration of the job is complete.) You can also limit the output reported back to the channel. To do this, give the `--report` option an integer representing the number of lines to return from the end of the log.

**WARNING!**
The `--report` switch will effectively block Lita from responding until the job is complete. If you have a small team and are using Lita in a sort of "single-threaded" manner, then this is fine. However, if you are using Lita for anything more complex, you probably don't want this. Lita will, however, queue up your requests during the execution time and respond accordingly when complete. I am looking for a solution to this at the moment.

Examples:

```
Lita > lita rundeck run aliasfoo
Execution 285 is running. Average job duration is 1.717 seconds.

Lita > rundeck run aliasfoo --options SECONDS=60
Execution 286 is running. Average job duration is 1.717 seconds.

Lita > rundeck run --project Litatest --job dateoutput
Execution 287 is running. Average job duration is 1.717 seconds.

Lita > rundeck run --project Litatest --job dateoutput --options SECONDS=30
Execution 288 is running. Average job duration is 1.717 seconds.

Lita > rundeck run --project Litatest --job dateoutput --options SECONDS=30,FORMAT=iso8601
Execution 289 is running. Average job duration is 1.717 seconds.

Lita > rundeck run --project Litatest --job dateoutput --options SECONDS=30,FORMAT=iso8601 --report 5
Execution 289 is running. Average job duration is 1.717 seconds.
Execution 289 output:
  18:18:27 26 Sat May 9 18:18:27 UTC 2015
  18:18:28 27 Sat May 9 18:18:28 UTC 2015
  18:18:29 28 Sat May 9 18:18:29 UTC 2015
  18:18:30 29 Sat May 9 18:18:30 UTC 2015
  18:18:31 30 Sat May 9 18:18:31 UTC 2015
Execution 289 is complete (took 30.49s)
```

* Users must be [added by a Lita admin](http://docs.lita.io/getting-started/usage/#authorization-groups) to the rundeck_users group to execute jobs
* Job names with spaces need to be quoted
* Multiple options can be submitted via comma-delimited key pairs
* Jobs identified via fully qualified project and job names (i.e. --project and --job) or via a registered alias
